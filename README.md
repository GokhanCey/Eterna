## 🔮 What is Eterna?
Eterna reimagines NPCs not as static scripts, but as living, evolving entities secured by consensus. By leveraging Amadeus's unique **Consensus-Level Compute**, Eterna agents run their inference deterministically across the network.

When you speak to an Eterna agent, your message is a transaction. The network validates the inference, updates the agent's memory state (Merkle Tree), and returns a response that is globally verified.

## 🚀 Features
*   **Soul Forge:** Create unique AI personalities with custom system prompts.
*   **Consensus Inference:** All responses are "Verified by Consensus" (simulated for prototype).
*   **Memory Visualization:** View the agent's evolving state (Friendship, Entropy, Knowledge).
*   **Permaweb Storage:** Optional integration with **Arweave** for eternal memory preservation.
*   **Marketplace:** Trade and adopt "Pre-Loved" souls with proven on-chain history.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 + Framer Motion
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Amadeus Genesis Runtime (Mocked RPC)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
